    <h1>My Biography</h1>
    <div class="content-container">
        <div class="text-content">
    <p> Hello! My name is Owen Smith, I am a third year student at Simon Fraser University studying Software Systems. I have a strong passion for creating successful
    and impactful work. Currently, I am exploring web design(html/css), artificial intelligence and project management as I work on projects that combine creativity with 
    practical solutions. 
    Alongside my technical pursuits, I thrive on seeing success in my own and in my teams work, whether that be on a soccer field, my friends or creating software. I am 
    captain of my mens league team after we together have promoted back to back seasons, this means a lot to me personally because I saw the effort that went into this accomplishment
    from me and all of my teammates. 
    For a more personal description - I am the third child of four, who grew up with my close in age siblings and was always competing. I've played soccer for over 15 years, 
    and played every position at a high level. I also have worked in construction building concrete foundations for homes across the lower mainland for over 4 years. I value integrity
    and respect a lot, as from my experience, working with others succeeds the most built on integrity and accountability.</p>
    <h2>Software</h2>
    <p>I enjoy programming and creating software projects because they are inherently problem-solving dependent. I love the challenge of breaking down complex issues into manageable 
    tasks and then developing solutions. My experience with UI's has taught me the importance of having a user-centered mindset while designing, because the impact of the UI is so large.
    I'm very excited to see where my journey in the software world takes me, learning new technologies and techniques to enhnace my skills and contribute to various projects </p>
